That's where you come in! Get on the CV discord and to look for commissioned builds, or advertise yourself!</p><h4>Pre-made Parcels</h4><p>Did you know that it's possible to sell an entire build without needing to own a parcel?</p><p>It's true!</p><p>Simple create a building using a free-to-create off-world '<a href="https://www.cryptovoxels.com/account/spaces">Spaces</a>' parcel, create a video to show it off, then just export it's JSON and list the video on opensea with the json as unlockable content! When purchased, owners can take the unlocked json file and load their in-world parcel parcel with it.</p><h4>On Commission</h4><p>Not all, but quite a few of the parcels you see shown on Metacat's <a href="https://www.metacat.world/">Website</a> were build for clients. This is a serious industry with professional designers and <a href="https://voxelarchitects.com/">architects</a> entering the metaverse to serve this exact need! Patrick Wood's <a href="https://patrickwood.myportfolio.com/">Architecture</a> Page demonstrates this beautifully.</p><h3>Websites</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.metacat.world">Metacat</a> - Specializing in Data Analytics and Content Navigation, Metacat has made a name for themselves an integral component of the CV community by providing insights, hosting events, and beyond</p></li><li><p><a href="https://predictcrypto.org/school-of-data-science">School of Data Science</a> - Ricky Espalon, who works at <a href="https://thegraph.com/">the graph</a> uses his parcel to teach others how to use big data and the graph!</p></li><li><p><a href="./">cvminigames</a> - Is the website I host and where I market my skills and provide free services to others!</p></li></ul><h3>Stories</h3><p>Add value to your assets by creating compelling stories that people will want to own!</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoXoB">Ancient Encounters</a> - The first immersive experience Ran by XoB, it had 750 people visit in the first 3 days. Play the game and buy their assets (if you like em)!</p></li><li><p><a href="https://medium.com/@kasey_2741">Scarcity Discoveries</a> - The entire island of Scarcity had themed NFT's buried underneath them.

Buy one of his parcels or associated NFT's to own a piece of the story!</p></li></ul><h3>Games</h3><p>This is the path I took. After listening to countless Bankless podcasts where they told me to get a job in crypto and advising the best way to get started is by engaging with the community. I finally took the leap! People saw what I could do from the website I made, in-world builds, or through my participation on discord. Subsequently, I've found no shortage of work!</p></details><details><summary><h2>Promoting</h2></summary><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style=""><a href="https://twitter.com/bitpixi/status/1496218372316532736"></a></blockquote><p>Have a project of your own with a ravenous fan base?</p><p>Why not give them a place to call their own in the metaverse?</p><p>Many projects have a presense here in cryptovoxels, here are just a few examples:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/juiceboxETH">JuiceboxDao</a> - is a programmable treasury for community-owned Ethereum projects with a strong creator base in Cryptovoxels</p></li><li><p><a href="https://linktr.ee/DAOrecords">DaoRecords</a> - Is a Web3 Record Label Launchpad &amp; DAO with a homebase in CV</p></li></ul></details><details style="background:#eee"><summary><h2>Art</h2></summary><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" style=""><a href="https://twitter.com/k1ic234/status/1485554182778077184"></a></blockquote><p>This could fall into several other sections but I gave it it's own...</p><p>Take note that there are many opportunities to showcase your art weather you have a parcel or not.
