These gnomes liked the work on the mines, and Drog convince them all in a town meeting that they should mine the empty land from the gnomes that followed Necro, Tilt and the others. Although many people disagreed, there was a large group following Drog, and the Fire Faction, from the blacksmiths, joined the Earth Faction in this decision. In the abscence of the other leaders, the remaining people decided not to act against Drog and the earth and fire factions, that were fighting for land reform for non-used land.

Abundance grew in technology and wealth, and the gnomes developed wonderful machines with god-like capabilities, like flying machines, healing machines and they could even talk to the dead. But Necro, a gnome interested in the old dark arts, was not satisfied with talking to the dead. Her wife was killed in a lab accident, and he wanted to resurrect her. This was not an easy task, and for doing so Necro gathered a large group of gnomes to go to Flora Island meeting the great immortal druid. Klava, the druid was alive since immemorial ages, and he is known for being immortal and for having an open passage to the underworld. For centuries, the new Dark ones were studying the arts of life, death and undeath.","external_url":"https:\/\/www.cryptovoxels.com\/collections\/294\/549","":"Books","vox":"https:\/\/www.cryptovoxels.com\/w\/7c3d3f66c3df58ee9d37b956adbeea30376d8c19\/vox","issues":100,"rarity":"rare"},{"name":"Scarcity Tales: Air Faction","image":"https:\/\/wearables.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com\/38f0c1d3-f6a3-4c68-8fc7-c907de155fe1-scarcity-tales-air-faction.gif","description":"The Air Faction was formed a long time ago, and maybe it was the 2nd specialized profession from the gnomes\u2019 island, Abundance.
