    "- Womp portals are spherical - Cluny\n",
    "- Images can be made to look curved by cropping them accordingly in an image editor. - [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrK3EINyF3Y&t=2589s)\n",
    "- (near) Invisible Walls can be made by using a 'cube' feature with near .1m width and depth - Bitpixi & Dedcel\n",

    "hey just one thing to note - if you save an image of text with black text on white background, you don't even have to make it a transparent image.  Black text on white background with \"multiply\" blend mode (the default blend mode) works like a transparency.  Actually works better than a transparency because it doesn't have the weird blending artifacts that happens with transparencies when one transparent image is in front of another image from the perspective of the viewer."
