First, it'd check the content of the parcel for discoveries that may signify that places \"role\". Secondly, it looks at the hats/discoveries being worn by a user. From there it gets a bit iffy, but from what I see, we'd need some rules governing how players can interact with the space, NPC's in the space, and  with other users; given the spaces 'role' and the users equipped items.  People should be able to contribute and configure their own assets or NPCs to the game with generic properties and support for NPCs to have conditional conversations based on assets worn and the users progress in the mini-games 'story-line'. This would require an external server to handle the management of all these rules, dialogs, and 'state' information of the user.

Her wife was killed in a lab accident, and he wanted to resurrect her. This was not an easy task, and for doing so Necro gathered a large group of gnomes to go to \n","Flora meet the great immortal druid.

These gnomes liked the work on the mines, and Drog convince them all in a town meeting that they \n","should mine the empty land from the gnomes that followed Necro. Although many people disagreed, there was a large group of gnomes following Drog, and the other ones, as they were not affected, decided not to act against Drog and the new Earth Faction.\n","\n","The mayor, Tilt, only cared about the expansion of the Abundance Empire, and he was not in the island when Drog called the town meeting. Tilt was looking for Atlantis with the island army deep inside the ocean. The old legends told that Atlantis people had a \n","marvelous treasure full of magic items; and gnomes love to transform magic in technology. The Water Faction was formed by Tilt’s followers that were looking for magic in the depths of the ocean, but they were not a faction until they returned and saw \n","Abundance turned into Scarcity.\n","\n","The Air Faction was formed a long time ago, and maybe it was the 2nd specialized profession from the gnomes’ island. They were the air vehicle builders. Thanks to the Air Gnomes, society developed so much, and it was possible to build so much wealth. \n","Thanks to their powerful machines, the gnomes could explore the vastity of the metaverse and they could mine every Cryptovoxels island before they are minted. The air vehicle builders were responsible for 1st  expansion of the Abundance Empire and they \n","were the first rulers of the new empty conquered islands.

The supervisor of the factory was summoned and it was discovered that the site the building had been built on was territory belonging to the Dark gnome faction long ago.

A survey of the other two sites purchased for the project revealed a hidden water gnome faction and fire gnome faction, all weakened and hiding in the interdimensional portals.

But the Astrocryptids negotiated that the three territories be a peaceful haven for any gnome from any faction as long as they promised to not fight within the boundaries. Any gnome could get food and was welcomed as company at the factory, bakery, or ice cream shop as gratitude for the use of the land.

These vibrations, if aligned with other gnome relics in its surroundings, could cause a sympathetic resonance, potentially resulting in the hat spawning multiple iterations of itself outside of the vault. Gnome relics were often kept buried underground to prevent such an occurrence, since it was known that the hat spawns could bring about unpredictable occurrences (ie, bad weather, upside down worlds, etc).\n","\n","Now, for anyone who has spent some time studying the origins of sound, it’s clear that an 11th dimension frequency takes on a “cloud like” or “granular” quality. If you listen carefully it appears that the sounds coming from ‘Ol Bronze just so happen to match that quality! This could mean that a recent hat spawning could — or might already have — taken place…\n","\n","Now, we don’t know the true location of the Vault of Reliquaries, and we can’t assume that it might actually be in or near the Bronze mines. However, with the amount of digging and building that has been taking place, it’s possible that some gnome relics were discovered, unburied and moved. Exposing these relics might have accidentally put them in direct alignment with the vault, amplifying the 11th dimension frequencies of the hat, and initiating a new wave of spawning.\n","\n","I would wander around in the maze a bit more before starting to dig.
