          <p>With the introduction of Scarcity Island, a burgeoning story has began to form in the CV-Metaverse. </p>
<p>Lit by Bitpixi and brought into reality by the CV dev team, 'Scarcity-Discoveries' have ignited a fire in our hearts and minds. </p>
<p>Since their reveal, a dauntless core of of creatives have banded (loosely) together to keep our &quot;cosa nostra&quot; rolling.</p>
<p>Below you will find a breakdown of SOME of these participants and SOME of their contributions towards the ever-developing CV Meta Story. </p>

<h2>Bitpixi</h2>
<p>Who better to kick off our list but the one who started it all?</p>
<p>Bitpixi, who works for Cryptovoxels, introduced us CVlians to the dwarfs of Scarcity Island.</p>
<p>In and amongst the basements of Scarcity Island were strange discoveries to be found. What were they and where did they come from? It appeared at first that only Bitpixi could tell. </p>
<p>A prolific writter, <a href="https://medium.com/@kasey_2741">Bitpixi's blog</a> held the keys to explaining what all this was about.</p>

<p>Some notable quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unknown whether it’s by Celxi Pebblestone as well, a fan of her work, or a forger
but they use her color palettes
She’s a middle class modern artist gnome who kind of predates / ignores cyberpunk faction? Her famous series are based on the 7 days of the gnomish week, and so too are the statues
So to figure out if she’s also the artist of the statues, maybe examine if anyone used any special machines, or just regular materials in the process? That might be a clue</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Just wait until you see my Rare Coprolith of a Roginspar Aqrabuamelu Face with tears of joy (the fossilized poop of a half-scorpion half-man who can animate statues and render zombie parasites harmless with a cold fire.. who was once a statue himself by gnome artist Thistle Rogin) Gnome recursion...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At it's heart, the artifacts found in these basements appear to have properties that denote the gnome factions that would own them. What these gnomes did with the artifacts is anybodies guess.  </p>

<h2>The_Philosopher</h2>
<p>Picking up what Bitpixi put down, The Philosopher is perhaps our lores most prolific writer. Creating stories for each of the islands, and NFT's to match; The Philosopher has teamed up with Bitpixi to establish official minigames built around these stories.

</blockquote><h2>Cluny the Scourge</h2>
<p>is an enormous rat. Missing one eye and grizzled from a life of piracy, much leaner than his warlord days after years of life as a hermit in the wilds of Mossflower - Cluny once again feels the familiar itch to travel the seas. But now Cluny voyages in search of meaning and redemption and may have found both on the shores of Scarcity Island. While soaking in the natural hot springs on top of a crystal tower, Cluny decided Scarcity was home.</p>
<p>The following are Cluny's reports to the Lost Gnome Society of discoveries made while exploring the island and the caverns below the Crystal Staircase.  </p>
<p>https://peakd.com/cryptovoxels/@cluny.the.rat/clunys-scarcity-chronicles-foreward-and-chpt1
<em>Also see Cluny's first person narrative blog - largely distilled from the material originally shared in the CryptoVoxels Discord and found here on this website</em></p>
<h2>The Crystal Staircase (29 Emerald Avenue)</h2>
<p>https://www.cryptovoxels.com/parcels/6619</p>
<ul>
<li>Carved out of the solid rock and crystal by the ancients in the before times.</li>
<li>A staircase to the sunless sea below Scarcity and the caverns beyond.</li>
<li>Rooftop soaking pools have healing properties.</li>
<li>There are gnome zombies down below and a rare zombie dolmentaz crystal (dark faction NFT discovery) on the rooftop</li>
</ul>
<p>As I continue to chip away at the matrix holding the Crystal Staircase I have made a few more discoveries.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, the crystal is a hydrated solid containing water of crystallization trapped inside the crystal lattice. </li>
<li>Second, analysis of the water and dissolved contaminants excluded from the crystal formation indicate to me the presence of a deep subterranean sea below my parcel.  </li>
</ul>
<p>I know there must be a fissure of considerable size below my basement because the magic dragonturtle must have crawled up from this dark sea.
This also casts a new light on the lore my zombie gnome informants first told me about the crystal staircase - they said it was an ancient crystal carved into a staircase to the &quot;open world&quot;. At the time, I thought this was a very prescient allusion to the metaverse / web3. I realize now it is a staircase up to the open world (our world, the world with a sky) from the hollow world, Jules Verne Journey to the Center of the Earth style. </p>
<p>This crystal is growing out of huge caverns in the underdark, which I wager contain much more than the dark sea I mentioned before.<br />
On a related fun build note you can now swim from the rooftop soaking pools down into the flooded basement through a connected series of flooded chambers inside the Crystal Staircase.</p>
<p>This turtle dragon thing crawled out of the pool at the basement of my plot. I think it was drawn to the energy coming from the zombie stone. It is floating around above the zombie stone now basking in its radiation.  I checked in on the dragon turtle again this morning and it seems to have settled in. It is still lolling around basking in the radiation from the zombie stone and I swear it has grown larger since last night. I also noticed it is shimmering in time with the killer riffs emanating from @nic 's giant guitar &amp; the pick of destiny. So far it seems harmless enough though. Maybe I will turn it into a wearable steed</p>
<p>so this is actually strange. My basement flooded at 29 Emerald (a temporary glitch - thanks @bitpixi.eth for screencap of flood!) </p>
<p>I thought it looked cool and with bitpixi's help sort of recreated the effect of flooded basement - it fits my lore that the pool of water at the bottom of the basement was a portal, and the dragonturtle came up from there.</p>
<p>I moved my avatar into the flooded basement and when I came back out I saw myself still sitting there on the road! Did I... did I just go into a mirror dimension when I entered the water and now I am stuck in this side while my doppelganger is roaming around in the real world?!?</p>
<p>I'm having a stare off with my doppelganger. I can't figure out if I am stuck in the mirror dimension or my doppelganger is</p>
<p>nic — 12/18/2021
I saw this happen glad I kept a safe distance</p>
<h2>Zombie Alien Parasites</h2>
<p>Well things are just going from weird to worse 🙂 I was just strolling by the Bronze treasury and yeah damned if I didn't see a zombie neck stabber hanging out under the weird zombie dark crystal 😳  Cons of a zombie neck stabber infestation include that they will inject nanobots from the future into your neck - this will turn you into a zombie. There is an interesting pro however - until you turn into a zombie, you can see into the past through the neck stabber's eyes.</p>
<p>My gnome zombie informant was correct, there are definitely zombie heart displacers in the Bronze treasury 😳  They crawl around kinda like scorpions but as a wearable this would replace the torso with the row of green being the backbone and the &quot;legs&quot; turning into a skeletal rib cage with no heart. If you let one crawl onto you it will turn you into a zombie, but your heart will be displaced into a future timeline (possibly saving your mortal soul). To reiterate the bit of gnome lore I mentioned above, a popular gnomish heresy holds that the soul resides in the heart, while gnome orthodoxy of course holds that the soul resides in the tip of the pointy hat</p>
<p>I'm getting some interesting results from preliminary analysis of the neck stabbers &amp; heart displacers using the cyberpunk artifacts I recently uncovered.  Both creatures appear to be genetically modified organisms created by splicing genes from a yet unidentified alien species with terrestrial arthropods. I was able to isolate some proprietary gene sequences created by Akaromi BioCorp, which is a little confusing considering Akaromi is known as an AgriCorp. The machinery I am using itself was manufactured by Arasaka MegaCorp, but had been rooted &amp; jailbroken at some point in the past. I think there may be a gnome hacker resistance in the cyberpunk timeline that has been using the tools of the corporations against them.</p>
<p>Goblinhead Spiders have appeared on scarcity - they appear to be controlling the other alien creatures. Now available as a wearable - intended either as the bottom piece of a three piece set, with the Zombie Heart Displacer connecting to the tail of the goblinhead spider (with the goblinhead in the rear facing away from the neck stabber head on top of the heart displacer, with the whole thing kind of like a spider-taur) - or worn as a head piece on its own with the goblinhead in front. </p>
<h2>Gnome Lore</h2>
<p>The gnomes are a little prudish huh. They even wear their pointy hats and long stockings while swimming lol</p>
<p>I just learned something about gnomes while sculpting a gnome head. Please never confuse a gnome with a dwarf. Everyone knows dwarves are inferior because they only have one beard, while all proper gnomes have two beards.</p>
<p>Also did you all hear the rumor that there is only one sex of gnomes and they reproduce by crafting crystal babies?
My gnome informants have been very cagey on the topic. Can't get much out of them</p>
<h4>The Heresy of Hagarthi the Immaterial</h4>
<p>An ascetic gnome monk retreated to a mountain cave for a decade of fasting in silence and was never seen again. A search party from the monastery was sent on the 11th year and found only Hagarthi's pointy hat sitting pristinely in the middle of the cave. The hat began emanating vibrations in the 11th dimension once placed in the Vault of Reliquaries back in the monastery, causing the same recurring dream for all the monks in the monastery. </p>
<p>In this dream Hagarthi appeared and shared a revelation: After achieving a transcendent state in meditation, Hagarthi's body de-materialized and regained consciousness after meditation as the hat. Hagarthi had glimpsed the true nature of Gnomish reality; the physical body is but a reflection of the true gnome which always resides in a pointy hat (the pointy shape serving as a conduit between the false reality and the true hativerse).</p>
<p>This revelation was rejected as a heinous heresy of the 12th degree at the third council of Hrghrvtfffan and Hagarthi's hat was removed to the crypts. Hagarthi re-materialized from the hat (in the eyes of some observers proving the heresy correct) and promptly marched the hat back to the Vault of Reliquaries whence Hagarthi de-materialized again and the hat has remained ever since.
Adherents to the Heresy of Hagarthi left behind a scroll which seems to imply that the pointy hats found around Scarcity are actually the missing gnomes in a state of suspended potentiality, perhaps waiting for the vibration of the perfect frequency to return.</p>
<p>Cluny.eth — 12/19/2021
@jamesfinnerty.eth The beep boop beep bip robot tinkling noises? This is intriguing...  By Hagarthi's Beard you were right! I followed the noises to their source and located the hat!!!</p>

<h2>Cyberpunk Artifacts</h2>
<p>The machinery in the Scarcity Research Lab was manufactured by Arasaka MegaCorp, but has been rooted &amp; jailbroken at some point in the past. I think there may be a gnome hacker resistance in the cyberpunk timeline that has been using the tools of the corporations against them.</p>
<p>I reversed the polarity of the circuit connected to the cyberpunk crystal and attempted to send a broadcast to any cyberpunk gnome hackers out there - I'm not sure if it was received, the crystal began overheating and I had to kill the broadcast. I will report back if I hear anything in return.</p>
<p>My plan with the cyberpunk artifacts is to make them modular so they can be assembled together into lots of different configurations. Also since they have been rooted/jailbroken, the cyberpunk gnome hackers have loaded lots of different functionalities into units that may look the same (just swap out some display GIFs and that could be a replicator, or a shower, or put an &quot;occupied&quot; sign and it is a portapotty etc. LOL. Then of course we may find some of the unmodified original equipment that the corporations were using, unclear what the original purpose was but it had something to do with the alien creatures and the zombie nanobot plague.  Also, these will be wearables that can be used to make a weird cyborg kind of costume once I have it all figured out 🙂 Happy new year all and cheers to lots more weirdness in scarcity!</p>
<p>Thanks to the awesome @BeeBee my cyberpunk artifact research lab is now protected with blast doors which can only be opened by pressing the big red button on the security pad  🙂  Having to use the red button actually fits with the cyberpunk gnome hacker lore, they obviously bypassed the corporation's biometric security with these big red buttons they added LOL.  Try the doors out and investigate the research lab (if you dare)</p>
<p>it looks like the gnome hackers were trying to reverse engineer one of the infamous Arasaka Scanner Slicers but I am not sure it is safe to approach!  (I will eventually be adding these cyberpunk artifacts to the library but for now they mostly live in the research lab space here</p>
<p>can't get the &quot;add group to library&quot; feature to work tonight or I would have added a cyberpunk artifact builder's kit. I did add the five cyberpunk artifacts I have discovered so far to the Bronze treasury. These modular units are intended to fit together in a variety of ways, think of them like Lego for tech artifact building 🙂 Let me know if you make anything out of these 🙂 I'm going to just add the vox files here for now until I can add the group to the asset library</p>
<p>just made a Goggles &amp; Respirator wearable - the green crystal lenses let you see into the past/future/alternate dimensions (similar to how you can see through the eyes of a neck stabber, less the turning you into a zombie) and the respirator filters out spores &amp; zombie plague nanobots. This will be handy as we explore deeper under Scarcity </p>
<p>lookin' good - just womped The Anvil, that was the best coffee I have had in the many metaverses! One wonders if the reason I now seem to be able to breathe underwater has anything to do with these special Scarcity grown beans 🤔</p>
<p>I have been a bit puzzled why the Scarcity Research Lab (https://www.cryptovoxels.com/s/scarcityresearch ) is on the moon, and why the same types of crystals found around Scarcity seem to also be common on the lunar surface. So on a hunch I analyzed some rocks I collected from the moon and compared them to the rock composition in and around Scarcity. It appears that the huge caverns underneath Scarcity are actually evidence of the ancient impact that separated the moon from the world! The crystals formed both on Scarcity and the moon as the rock slowly cooled after the impact. The crystals are still connected - it is easy to send energy between pairs of like crystals in Scarcity and on the moon!</p>
<p>have been exploring the caverns under Scarcity. I have seen things in these sunless realms that defy explanation. What I learned in the caves withered and bleached my paltry human intellect but fear not I have emerged from the flames stronger for the forging. </p>

<p>I can't remember where the mushrooms came from - @bitpixi.eth @karpatic I think it was the ethical hackers guild maybe and a bunch of mushrooms sprouted up? Anyway I followed the mycelial networks down through the cave systems I have been exploring and it turns out the mushrooms are related to a D&amp;D adventure I cowrote/produced a while back (I'm Carl, it me). </p>
<p>In the published text we didn't clarify what the source of the magical radiation was that was causing the crazy magic mushroom mutations. Remember I noted that the same magic faction crystals occurring around Scarcity also occur on the moon?  It turns out this has created a resonant energy field from the crystal caves under Scarcity all the way up to the moon. Many of the dimensional/time instabilities/fractured timelines we are seeing are likely a result of this field.  This is also causing the insane mushroom growth in the undercaverns, the mycelial networks are feeding off the magical energy and expressing properties of all the factions.

<p>BTW this is a &quot;pay what you want&quot; PDF so if you want to check out the adventure, just put &quot;$0&quot; in the field and you can download it for free</p>
<p>2 Cycas &amp; 3 Cycas Terrace</p>
<p>2 Cycas Terrace I want to keep the mother tree</p>
<p>It is quite possible that one of the megacorps from the cyberpunk future/alternate present got a hold of some of the Astrocryptids' experimental life forms and mutated them to their own purposes - from what I have gathered so far, there were at least two megacorps involved in this, initially an agricorp was creating alien clone workers (possibly from a base creature created by the Astrocryptids I am thinking now?) to tend the mycelial farms underneath Scarcity, and then a separate military/tech corp modified the agricultural clone workers to create the zombie alien parasites. Lots to chew on</p>

<p>When the hunt for the lost gnomes begins, I figured it would be useful to have someplace to plan out missions, organize expeditions and such. I'm proposing we form the 'Lost Gnome Society' using Bronze Town Hall as its headquarters. All in favour?</p>
<p>I emerged from the underworld far below to discover some strange vibrations emanating from within the Bronze mines. I highly suggest you take a look.</p>
<p>jamesfinnerty.eth — 12/18/2021
To my understanding, after Hagarthi rematerialized to human form and left the hat, a strong 11th dimension vibration artifact remained within the hat itself. These vibrations, if aligned with other gnome relics in its surroundings, could cause a sympathetic resonance, potentially resulting in the hat spawning multiple iterations of itself outside of the vault. Gnome relics were often kept buried underground to prevent such an occurrence, since it was known that the hat spawns could bring about unpredictable occurrences (ie, bad weather, upside down worlds, etc).</p>
<p>Now, for anyone who has spent some time studying the origins of sound, it’s clear that an 11th dimension frequency takes on a “cloud like” or “granular” quality. If you listen carefully it appears that the sounds coming from ‘Ol Bronze just so happen to match that quality! This could mean that a recent hat spawning could — or might already have — taken place…</p>
<p>Now, we don’t know the true location of the Vault of Reliquaries, and we can’t assume that it might actually be in or near the Bronze mines. However, with the amount of digging and building that has been taking place, it’s possible that some gnome relics were discovered, unburied and moved. Exposing these relics might have accidentally put them in direct alignment with the vault, amplifying the 11th dimension frequencies of the hat, and initiating a new wave of spawning.</p>
<p>I would wander around in the maze a bit more before starting to dig. It could be that any further displacement would put these frequencies out of alignment, risking the potential of discovering any newly spawned hats.</p>
<p>Keep searching… these things are usually in plain sight.</p>
