<summary><h2>OnBoarding</h2>
</summary><style>
    details{ background: #eee; display: inline}
    summary{ color: gray; background: #fff }
</style>
<li> Introductory/ onboarding 'welcome' page & flow <details><summary style="color:orange">(More+)</summary>Maybe create an 'official sandbox' space where people can build, test and play. Thinking about dropping this experience near voxcon. Need to draw distinction between new builder and users. We could build off the intro popup to new users where we offer them options to further be introduced (build | costumes | user basics). Or a tutorial 'space' that is entirely dedicated for new users</details> </li> 
<li> &noob=true <details ><summary style="color:red">(More+)</summary>How would we go about doing this? Possibly recycle the 'welcome' page. or provide an even more aggressive tooltip-esque something that can be dismissible or just improve the tooltips? Are the current tooltips not seen? Need more information.</details> </li>
<li> Better wearables Support & editor UI <details><summary style="color:orange">(More+)</summary>Existing Improvements -> Body part selection, increased limits, download & uploading. <br> Needed Improvements -> Design overhaul. Skin & wearable labels -> body part may be confusing. <br> Challenges -> Not breaking existing costumes. Picking up objects in-world "IsPickable" <br> Ideal -> In-world costumer </details> </li> 
<li> Scripts: syntax highlighting & error reporting <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>We do now report the errors in the console log! Thinking about using an external IDE instead of recreating it.</details> </li> 
<li> Not Logged In: dress<details><summary style="color:orange">(More+)</summary>Anons can talk but are censored (bug w/ the censor mechanism currently exists). Unsure about voice chat but if we scrap boomboxes we'll try and set up permissioning. Default dresses? Dress: Off chain wearables for logged-in new users.</details> </li> 
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'> Not Logged In: talking (w /mute btn) </span><details><summary style="color:orange">(More+)</summary> Click to "Mute" user. Users may not know they are muted or not if someone does it to them which could get awkward. Easy to do it with text but not clear with audio. "add voice to moible and hosts and muting" </details> </li> 
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'> Not Logged Names </span> & voxels.com/ ens subdomains <details><summary style="color:green">(More+)</summary> Welcome window for temporary names (Form needs work from a toggle-able option to mint to a branched view. Also a bit of technical issue atm with implementation. Prefix anon names?)<- &#128119. Permit username.voxels.eth. ens subdomains are subject to eth fees for minting subdomain -> (via records -> address ) </details> </li> 
<li> Auto-generated building started showing off their possessions <details><summary style="color:orange">(More+)</summary> A simple iteration of this is very do-able. Will be exploring this more. </details> </li> 
<li> Gnosis wallets <details><summary style='color:green'>(More+)</summary>Support Added!</details> </li> 
<li> Multi-Sig wallets <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Wallets outside of gnosis are not supported!</details> </li> </details>
<details>
<summary><h2>Interactivity</h2>
</summary><style>
    details{ background: #eee; display: inline}
    summary{ color: gray; background: #fff }
</style>
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'> Defining character behaviors and interactions </span> <details ><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary> We unsure where to place it but are working on it and how best to create the feature. Stig is working on something and so is CVMinigames</details> </li> 
<li> Ability for items/players within your parcel to be damaged. <details><summary style='color:red'>(More+)</summary>This will come in time. We'd like to make dialogs work </details> </li> 
<li> Ability to attack items/players <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Scripting bundle supports click on players. We could expand on this; Possibly best developed in game-engine/ scripting environment<details> </li> 
<li> Picking up objects in-world "IsPickable" <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Want to see object in first person. May be possible in Babylon 5. Marcus will look into being able to pick up items without the arm moving left and right</details> </li> 
<li> Friendslist & chat features <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>ADRESS BOOK IS A GOOD IDEA. | Long term on our roadmap: Challenges = 1) Decentraland chat feature attempted but was a no go (required too much authorization & barriers). Ben dropped 'matrix' chat but we have the desire to use it. </details> </li> 
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'> vidscreen support for binding any key </span> <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>We can certainly expand this but it may be nuked inetailsture. </details> </li>
<li> NFT ticketing (restrict access) <details><summary style='color:green'>(NA)</summary>Works. People are happy. But not 100% done. Evidently it can be 'hacked' past by 'destroying' the parcel bouncer. Ugly BOX! => We'd like to change the color of the parcel. Transparency settings? </details> </li>
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'> Import/Export </span> builds to Spaces <details><summary style='color:green'>(More+)</summary>Could be made easier. User experience issue w/ max space size and orientation. Can import into spaces from in-world a size bigger than normally permitted.</details> </li>
<li> RTMP server support -> BS direct stream support <details><summary style='color:red'>(More+)</summary> HLS Direct stream support, not necessarily OBS. From chrome 76+, flash is blocked by default. OBS sends rtmp to twitch which then converts it to hls. </details> </li>
<li> In-world Opensea Payments <details><summary style='color:red'>(More+)</summary>Only works for Eth NFT's at the moment. Polygon not supported for opensea yet.</details> </li>
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'> Left-Right Wearable Prompt </span> <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary> This is a great idea. We'd just need to edit the wearables editor a bit to hardcode the parts of body that can do this.</details> </li>
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'>  in-world links pop out in a new tab</span> <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Will be talking to Bitpixi about this shortly. </details> </li></details>
<details>
<summary><h2>Social</h2>
</summary><style>
    details{ background: #eee; display: inline}
    summary{ color: gray; background: #fff }
</style>
<li> Featured content <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Kasey is working on a redesign of the homepage. We'd need to rearrange area on the homepage for this. </details> </li>
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'> Womp "browser" Update </span> <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Add a Womps by user/ timestamp page/ Dedicated page for womps (and/ or events) </details> </li>
<li> Regular content: podcast, music, gaming, building livestreams <details><summary  style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>This can get expensive from what we've seen but we are very interested. It's very broad but that's great for exploration. Professional content being produced may be a no-go for now. But the team has been producing content and been more outward facing recently so this may be a natural progression. twitch streaming.</details> </li> 
<li> Advanced (agenda) Invite links <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Make events page more clear. A sharaable link. (add to calander) btns. show appropriately on social media.</details> </li> 
<li> Community DAOs. <details><summary style="color: orange">(More+)</summary>Someone suggested creating quadratic strategies on snapshot that recognizes the suburb variable in cv erc721 metadata
https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies#checklist-for-adding-a-new-strategy
use existing quadratic strategies for reference, here
https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/tree/master/src/strategies
each suburb will need an ENS name to register their snapshot page
& that's it. gasless voting per suburb using existing NFTs. We didn't want to rely even further on 3rd parties. This is a big goal. Provided as an entirely new microservice with a subdomain.</details> </li>
<li> After 2 months community editable wireframe plots. <details><summary style="color: orange">(More+)</summary>Not recommended if by DAO since this may be manipulated. Extent of governance & what of whales/ propriety/ how to code the automation.</details> </li> 
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'> Common parcels Map Icon </span><details><summary style="color: red">(More+)</summary>No way to show people common parcels (not sandbox). Need showing on map and on 'parcels' page in some way. </details> </li> 
<li> Districts Official Hubs <details><summary style="color: red">(More+)</summary>We like the idea but want the community to build  out the first prototypes. We could add more Commons by district. </details> </li> 
<li> Metaverse Live DJ / Musician service register <details><summary style="color: red">(More+)</summary>Asking price per minute, availability and lead notice time. Basically rebuilding a website + providing moderation. This may be too laborious? Do we add it a feature of a users profile page? or do we just replicate the discord? </details> </li>
<li> daisy chains portals from OC spawn point. "official CV tour"<details><summary style="color: orange">(More+)</summary>Worried about 'breaking' the chain or players getting lost. "it's a scary thing". There is a desire to get rid of the portals. But also to revamp it. At a point of indecision. </details> </li>
<li> Have global themes and events. <details><summary style="color: green">(More+)</summary>Have done this several times. Once for halloween and once for xmas. Voxcon was a lil like this where users 'got the feeling' that 'something' was happening. Give popups telling people to check out new assets in the library for specific theme </details> </li>
<li> Share assets to Public library <details><summary style="color: green">(More+)</summary> Done! </details> </li>
<li> Mobile voice chat support <details><summary style="color: orange">(More+)</summary>Users can now txt chat. But the UI is terribly crammed. </details> </li>
<li> Zoom/videoconferencing <details><summary style="color: orange">(More+)</summary>When we tried, there were moderation issues. Will be moving forward with twilio + they have open source server nodes (something to look into). </details> </li>
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'> Audius integration </span> <details><summary style="color: orange">(More+)</summary>Does it build or benefit community/ create conflict of interest? Would people use it? </details> </li>
<li> Clubhouse integration <details><summary style="color: red">(More+)</summary>We can't speak on it as we don't know what it really is. Seems to specific and we can already provide much of this.</details> </li></details>

    details{ background: #eee; display: inline}
    summary{ color: gray; background: #fff }
</style>
<li> Server: Uptime & max concurrent users <details><summary style='color:red'>(More+)</summary>Goal for next year or two is to support upwards of 10K+ concurrent users. Michael and Josh working on multiplayer server (people who brought you multiplayer spaces and better connections)(Have bulked out analytics for our backend to better understand whats happening). </details> </li> 
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'> Multi-parcel management </span> <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Baking not possible. Perhaps we need to get a more actionable list. Where would we put these admin features? In-game or parcel-page? Are we changing settings or features.</details> </li> 
<li> Asset 3D click and drag edit <details><summary style='color:green'>(More+)</summary>Gizmos now provided!</details> </li>
<li> Asset Grouping <details ><summary style='color:green'>(More+)</summary>Possible</details> </li> </li>
<li> Bundled Wearables <details ><summary style='color:green'>(More+)</summary>Not possible with Matic but doable on Ethereum for opensea. Atm the description tag tells users purchase includes multiple items. OS issue > Voxels issue </details> </li> </li>
<li> Asset Marketplace <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Much like how the public library would work. Perhaps even a tab from within</details> </li>
<li> Permissioned boomboxes <details><summary style='color:red'>(More+)</summary>Parcel owners can now specify if the boombox is for contributors only or everyone but not 'on-the-spot'. But we may nuke the entire boombox feature now that we have voice-chat. It's currently used for streaming audio apart from yt or twitch.</details> </li>
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'> Permissioned Voice Chat </span> <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>On our roadmap. Should be like twitter spaces.</details> </li>
<li> Seamless adjacent parcel editing/ stuffs <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Shadows, Glass, Twitch Streams. Video stops playing. Textures (shared from multiple parcels using side-scroll review in editor panel) </details> </li>
<li> Copy an existing voxel instead of selecting from editor panel <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Not sure where we could put this on the key-mapping</details> </li>
<li> Increase tile texture resolution <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary> We need to better understand the constraints on image quality and why certain transformation on the image are performed. </details> </li>
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'> Image Quality on Select </span> <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Doable. People would want a Title + Description as well </details> </li>
<li> Debaking only when editing tiles <details><summary style='color:red'>(More+)</summary>Past developer attempted it but the project was very hard. We have code to pick up but it's agreed this is something we should do! (About a month of work)</details> </li>
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'>  Undo button (Ctrl+Z) </span> <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>It is now possible to rollback a build to a prior state. We had an 'undo' before ctrl+z. Many times the entire parcel got nuked w ctrl+z as the state saved after 30 seconds of inactivity. </details> </li>
<li> Access all past uploaded assets <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Access past assets by reviewing your parcel change log off the parcel main-page. Recycling content would be good for us from a storage perspective. Was not possible to do a more advanced implementation of this until recently. Thinking through the user experience may be complex as its kind of like file mgmt. (About 2 weeks of work)</details> </li>
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'> Filter + Sort + Search Assets </span> <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Sorting & Filter by type have been implemented</details> </li>
<li> Seamless lightmaps (parcel to parcel)<details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>No information available at this time. Ben has worked on it quite a bit so we should talk with him on the current state of work. </details> </li>
<li> Labels (icon on map) Vs Tags <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary style='color:orange'> How would we differentiate? Which would go on map? We want to talk it through with some other members but at the moment there isn't too much a difference between them. Are the tags from a dictionary of possible ones or open ended? These questions effect the search function </details> </li>
<li> Magica VOXel shaders (light, alpha, etc) <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>We can't implement these features as the information is no integrated inside the 'description' of the vox file -> ie, the information has unknown encoding which means we can't parse the data. It would also create a major performance drag. IF someone could figure out how to parse this information it would really help though. </details> </li>
<li> Megavox collision lag fix <details><summary style='color:red'>(More+)</summary>No easy fix. Megavox has so many triangles and collision has to test for every single one. PC just explodes as a result. Vox extension is not optimized either.</details> </li>
<li> Stronger audio spatial rolloff <details><summary style='color:red'>(More+)</summary> Take a look into this CARLOS</details> </li>
<li> Lanterns: orientation and focus <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Could look into. Adding parameters isn't too hard</details> </li>
<li> Place images 1px away from walls <details><summary style='color:green'>(More+)</summary> May have already been corrected by now. A lil bit of fighting between 2 images still exist though.</details> </li>
<li> &#128119 <span  style='background:lightgreen'> More wearables for costumes </span> <details><summary style='color:green'>(More+)</summary>Increased from 7 to 9 and we are looking at increasing to 12 so as to match the sandbox. </details> </li>
<li> Fix Youtube/Twitch crashes <details><summary style='color:green'>(More+)</summary>Fixed. But we'll keep our eyes peeled.</details> </li>
<li> NFT Packs <details><summary style='color:green'>(More+)</summary>See [polygonpacks](https://polygonpacks.com/#/home) or [thirdweb](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/design/Multiwrap). Previously Benjy looked into </details> </li>
<li> VRM <details> <summary style='color:orange'> (More+) </summary>Marcus performing ongoing research & development. Able to upload but still needs work.</details></li></details>
<details>
<summary><h2>Misc</h2>
</summary><style>
    details{ background: #eee; display: inline}
    summary{ color: gray; background: #fff }
</style>
<li> More love to old islands <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>Parcel buybacks to create parks. Common parcels -> anyone in suburb can edit. Folk coin distributions are ongoing atm. Could look into 'rewards' but nft rewards that we make up are discouraged as we want to give something that will hold long-term value. </details> </li> 
<li> Road signs <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary>We should try it again. Value is seen but not sure if it would actually serve as well as we think it could. Perhaps this is something we want to bring back (or some version thereof). </details> </li> 
<li> Account Bound Flare <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary> It has potential. User gets to pick one that hangs above their avatar. </details> </li>
<li> Day/Night switch modes and/or sunlight cycle <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary> Not about to happen within the next 2 years. Depends on lightmap/ worldwide baking developments. We have the flag to change to the mode but the ui needs to be reloaded upon selection. </details> </li> 
<li> GIFs/ Video encode as full res video <details><summary style='color:orange'>(More+)</summary> No comment. 4k video in a virtual world is a tall order. Video compression is a requisite for reliable content. </details> </li>
<li> Moving Assets : 'Blue Box' reliable preview <details><summary style='color:orange' >(More+)</summary> Fully Agree.
