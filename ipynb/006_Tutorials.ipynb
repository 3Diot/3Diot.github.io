    "- Objects can be solid up to 5m above your parcel and 2.5m around the sides (unless bordered by a neighbor)\n",
    "- Voxels are 0.5 & the default avatar is ~1.75m but use 2.5m ceilings for best experience - Faylure\n",
    "- Womp portals are spherical - Cluny\n",
    "- Images can be made to look curved by cropping them accordingly in an image editor. - [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrK3EINyF3Y&t=2589s)\n",
    "- (near) Invisible Walls can be made by using a 'cube' feature with near .1m width and depth - Bitpixi & Dedcel\n",
    "- The Polytext feature can be solid even when placed well outside of the parcels range (This is a bug that intentionally isn't being fixed)\n",
    "- - Create a solid pier users can walk on for your waterfront property by placing and scaling an lowercase i on the water.  \n",
    "- Parcels look even bigger if you put a gif of fog right along the top\n",
    "- Create 3D images by placing the same image perpendicular and on top of each other\n",
    "- Hollowing out voxels will help load them faster\n",
    "- Quick swap your parcels interior by building out your designs in free spaces\n",
    "- Check the \"stretch\" box and then you will have to scale the image to the correct aspect ratio and the image will display correctly - Cluny\n",
    "- if you save an image of text with black text on white background, you don't even have to make it a transparent image.  Black text on white background with \"multiply\" blend mode (the default blend mode) works like a transparency.  Actually works better than a transparency because it doesn't have the weird blending artifacts that happens with transparencies when one transparent image is in front of another image from the perspective of the viewer. - Cluny\n",
    "- purple is \"active state\" whereas gray in innactive. fog is tuned to reduce data load\n",
    "- two boomboxes can be used at the same time\n",
    "- is your Hardware Acceleration on in Advanced settings of your browser? here's our uptime status page so you can check on if things are running smooth from our side https://status.crvox.com/\n",
    "- playing around some more with placing an image with text of the name of the destination in front of the view and taking a womp - (removing the image from the womp destination area after) - so the womp portal displays the name of the destination inside the womp portal.  Getting better results now that I am centering the text in the view when taking the womp\n",
    "- scripts are uploadable on vox models\n",
    "- 'correct' the rotation center angle using group\n",
    "- Save your parcel as a space then reimport once edits are done. \n",
    "- curved photos\n",
    "- photobooth \n",
    "- instachair\n",
    "- Richtext uses [maruku](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/maruku/proposal.html) under the hood\n",
